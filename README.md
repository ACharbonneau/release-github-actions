Once you publish the release, this action will automatically

1. Create branch for release
1. Change [tags](#tags) to release branch

## Installation
1. Setup workflow  
   e.g. `.github/workflows/release.yml`
   ```yaml
   on: release
   name: Release
   jobs:
     release:
       name: Release GitHub Actions
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Release GitHub Actions
           uses: technote-space/release-github-actions@v1
           with:
             GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
             ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}
   ```

### Required parameter
#### ACCESS_TOKEN

## Action event details
### Target event
- release
### Target action
- published

## Motivation
Release package needs all dependencies like `node_modules`, but usually they are not committed.  
So if you want to release `GitHub Actions`, you have to do following steps.  
1. Develop locally on the branch for develop
1. Build for release
1. Commit all source code including dependencies like `node_modules`
1. Add tags (consider major and minor versions)
1. Push to GitHub
1. Publish release

It is very troublesome to do this steps for every release.  

If you use this `GitHub Action`, the steps to do are simple.
1. Develop locally on the branch for develop
1. Publish release
1. Wait for the automated steps to finish
   1. Build for release
   1. Commit all source code including dependencies like `node_modules`
   1. Add tags (consider major and minor versions)
   1. Push to GitHub

## Addition
### tags 
Tag name format must be [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).  
The following tags will be created or attached to latest release.
- tag name
- major tag name (generated by tag name)
  - e.g. `v1`
- minor tag name (generated by tag name)
  - e.g. `v1.2`
